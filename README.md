# RepRap_Descendant
Mostly Printed, Highly Evolved

RepRap Descendant is a Mulbot-derived Prusa i3 descendant that is not capable of self-replication. The primary goal for this project was to decrease the Mulbot part count by integrating all the printed frame pieces into one single monocoque. The secondary goal is to meet or exceed the capabilities and build volume of a traditional i3, with a mostly printed design. A tertiary goal would be to have a large enough build volume to print all of the Mulbot components on the Descendant, since there is no mostly printed parent capable of fabricating the Mulbot at this time. The Descendant requires a mother RepRap with a 400x400x400 build volume for the frame (monocoque) fabrication.

I wish to acknowledge Angus from Maker’s Muse for his work on Fallout-themed 3d printer, which featured a single massive printed base. The video can be found here. https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6O91ussQeus

The “Descendant” name: since this machine descends from four other types of RepRaps (the i3, the Mulbot, Angus’s Fallout machine, and physically from a 400mm^3 parent), Descendant seemed fitting. It also implies it is a child and not a clone. 

Thanks to John Mulac Jr. for designing the Mulbot and pushing RepRap forward on the mostly-printed side of things. This inspirational design was badly needed and arrived at a very good time in my opinion. The Mulbot homepage can be found here: https://reprap.org/wiki/Mulbot
